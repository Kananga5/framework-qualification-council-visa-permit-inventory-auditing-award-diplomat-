Question:South African visa application process


    Confirm your place at a university registered with the Department of Higher Education

    Download the BI-1738 form and complete it

    Schedule an appointment with a local South African embassy, mission, or consulate in your home country

    Present your relevant documents and pay the application fee

    Wait to receive a decision on your application


Visas for international students’ dependants
Only your spouse and dependent children can travel with you to South Africa. They’ll need to apply for an accompanying spouse or child visa which allows them to live there for up to three years. However, it doesn’t entitle them to work or study in the country.
If your family members do plan on joining you, you should take proof of custody or guardianship to your visa application meeting.

Question:South African student visa requirements
It’s important that you bring all of the requested documents to your visa application meeting. Here’s a list of the resources you’ll be asked to bring along to your meeting:


    A valid passport with an expiry date at least 30 days beyond the end of your course

    Completed BI-1738 form

    An official letter of acceptance from your college or university on headed paper

    Money to pay the visa application fee

    Two additional passport photos in color

    A vaccination certificate (if required)

    A cover letter detailing the purpose and length of your visit

    The details of your arriving and departing flights, including your return ticket

    Proof of adequate financial resources

    Health insurance policy documents

    Medical records


South Africa student visa processing time
Applications can take up to 8 or even 10 weeks to be processed, so beginning the process as soon as you receive acceptance from your university is advised.
If there are any unforeseen delays, you might not get your visa in time if you leave it late, so start preparing your application as soon as possible.

Working while studying
South African student visas make it possible for you to earn while you learn. You can work up to 20 hours per week during term-time, and full-time during the university holidays if you wish.

What to do if your application is rejected
Having your visa application rejected is disappointing, but you have 10 days to lodge an appeal. To do so, you’ll need to arrange an appointment with your nearest visa facilitation services (VFS) center and fill out an online application form.
Common reasons for rejection include incomplete applications, applying for the wrong type of visa, failing to provide the requested supporting documents, and a lack of information about how you’ll afford to live in South Africa. Avoiding these mistakes will give you the best chance of success.

Question:Steps to get a study visa for Italy


    Accept an offer from a university: Pay any necessary fees to secure your place at the Italian university you have chosen.

    Contact or visit your nearest consulate or embassy: Find out the exact visa process for your home country, including the documents you need to complete, and schedule an interview for your Italian visa application.

    Attend a visa interview: Submit the documents asked for and pay the fee for this application.

    Wait for the results: You will receive a visa outcome in writing.

    Apply for a residence permit: Within eight days of arriving in Italy, you need to apply for your residence permit at your nearest Questura — a type of police station. EU students must also complete this step within 20 days of entering the country.

    Receive a permit: Your permit may take a couple of months to be created, so within this time you may be issued with a temporary document.


Italy student visa requirements


    Recent color passport style photograph

    Valid passport (the expiry date should be three months longer than that of the visa requested)

    Confirmation of a place at an Italian university

    Educational history and documents to support this

    Confirmation of accommodation in Italy

    Proof of finances to support yourself in Italy

    Health insurance


Italian student visa processing time
The processing of your visa application should usually take between one and three weeks, however, you should aim to schedule your visa interview around six weeks in advance.
That means you should start the process two or three months before your departure date. If you leave it too much later any delays in the process could mean you don't get your visa in time.

Working as a student in Italy
You can usually work up to 20 hours a week with a student residence permit in Italy. However, your employer will need to organize a work permit for you, which may take up to two months to process.

What to do if your visa application is rejected
Receiving a rejection letter can be distressing, but it doesn't have to mean the end of your plans to study in Italy.
The reason for the rejection should be included in the letter. If it's something that's easily fixed, like an incomplete form, you should submit a new application ensuring that everything is included.
Common reasons for a rejected Italian student visa application include:


    Lack of proof of funds to support yourself

    Incomplete application form
